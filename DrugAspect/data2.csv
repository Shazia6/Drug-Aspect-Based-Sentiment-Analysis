|Lamictal stabilized my serious mood swings. One minute I was clawing up the walls in pure mania# the next curled up in a fetal position on my bed contemplating suicdie. I am no longer at the whim of my moods and neither are those around me. I'm lucky that I started pharmaceuticals almost immediately after I was diagnosed a bipolar. Lamictal gives me amazing clarity to go about my day# honestly assess myself and form real relationships. Lamitcal lifted a fog# I guess you could call it. Now that I'm medicated I realize how cloudy my thought processes used to be. It's a wonderful feeling.

Interestingly# I hardly dreamt before beginning Lamictal. I would dream (I mean dream in the sense of being able to imagine pictures and scenes while asleep# not REM) maybe once every two months. Now I dream every night. I found that the closer I take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams.|,lamictal,2.0,1.0,9.0
Initial benefits were comparable to the brand name version of this drug# Depakote.  I had been taking Depakote for several months and experienced great results.  When I went to my psychiatrist for an evaluation and re-fill# he accidently prescribed the generic version# Depakene.  When I discovered the error# I was told by this doctor that I would experience the same results as Depakote.  The positive side effects of the Depakene: balanced mood# improved concentration# improved logical cognition# mental clarity# lessened anxiety and irritability# improved sleep# increase in pleasure about activities,depakene,3.0,2.0,4.0

Within one week of treatment superficial acne lesions were visibly reduced.

Ive been taking Tramadol for 2 weeks now. Ive been taking vicodin and percocuet for 7 months due to Cervial disk degeneration and lower back pain. I have to admit I loved taking Vicodin and percocuet. The problem is that they would knock me out. Tramadol has been awesome. It takes 90% of the pain away and I feel like I actually have energy again. From reading previous comments it sounds like I take a lower dose. Im really happy about that cause if I get use to it then I can up my dose and not feel worried about it.,ultram-er,2.0,1.0,10.0
I immediately stopped having panic attacks.  It really was miraculous# as they were becoming more and more frequent and severe.  On the combination of klonopin and prozac# I have not experienced a panic attack in 10 years. I simply feel "normal"# and am able to go through my days without any feelings of extreme nausea or dizziness# which is how my panic attacks manifested themselves.  No longer did I have to leave work early# avoid restaurants and supermarkets# or worry about getting suddenly "sick"# for no reason.,klonopin,2.0,3.0,10.0
the presumed benefits were to help with a severe depression. in the beginning there was some benefit# ie less suicidal# apathetic# morbid# depressed. but the effects were short lived and dose had to be continually increased. the biggest benefit was probably placebo - feeling like i was getting help# hopeful and trusting in the treatment and doctors.,effexor,4.0,5.0,1.0

Significantly diminished the symptoms and size of the cold sore.  Often# it would halt the development and the redness and swelling would disappear after a day or two# without the sore blistering/weeping/scabbing.

It is surprising how many people either do not treat cold sores# or are not aware of any new treatments after Zovirax.,valtrex,2.0,1.0,9.0
Treatment benefits were noticeable but not substantial. I did not respond to 100mg a day as I or the doctor had hoped.

The xanax would act as a downer. It would calm me temporaily but could throw me into depression depending on the situation. If the situation was mildly tramatic the xanax would calm me but then follow by depression. The following day I would have residual sedation. The main complain was the addiction. It was not exactly like a craving but if you did not take it your body would feel like something was missing. It did not hurt but until I took it again I felt not quite content and as soon as I would take the pill my body would feel like it would give a sigh of relief. I think it is as much addiction to the mind as to the body.,xanax,3.0,1.0,5.0

I have suffered of rapid heart rate for sometime because of my thyroid problem. I was given this medicine to get my heart rate controlled. First few weeks the medicine did not seem to work for me but my doctor increased the dosage to 20mg twice a day# then that was the time I started to feel my heart rate slow down.

i was severly depressed for weeks and would just cry all the time. i had tried several other anidepressants and none of them worked. one day my doctor said lets try a new drug called effexor xr. i was started on 75 mg for about 2 months and was still depressed so then i was increased to 150 mg and have been on it since. i an so much happier and my family is also. this medicine has been my life saver and recommend anyone depressed to take this one,effexor-xr,2.0,1.0,9.0

Initially prescribed 25mg Zoloft for depression # but after two weeks my condition was markedly worse. I realize that each of us have different tolerances to various substances# and after my GP changed the medication to 30mg daily of Cymbalta my condition started to improve# but relapsed after about 3 weeks. The assumption was that I had required the higher dose of 60mg daily# and since taking 60mg daily my condition has improved to be close to my normal happy self with interests in various things. My advice is to find the medication that 'agrees' with you and stick with it for at least 1 month.,cymbalta,1.0,1.0,7.0

As I was taking Seroquil for my Schitzophrenia# I would always wake up feeling exhausted and tired;still# even though I would take the medicine during the nights! I used to be stressed and aggravated all the time before Symbyax and Seroquil. Now that I'm on Symbyax# I'm emotionally numb and the voices in my head vanished.

Dramatic loss of weight and inches first week.  Settled into Meridia's Program provided over the Internet (comes with perscription).  Promised myself to follow the rules.  The toughest for me# was not to weigh myself everyday.  Meridia wanted me to check only once a week and I'm glad I refrained.  The thrill of seeing a huge difference each week has kept my knees from complaining.  The strength of Meridia has never lessened.  If I forget to take it# I feel like the bottom of my floor has opened up and I am in free fall.  It really is strange...  When I take it with my vitamins each morning# it gives me a definite feeling of support.  I am loosing 2 lbs each week along with inches.  I'm doing better than what they advertise but that is probably because I have a gym in my home.  I walk 70 miles/mo. and do free weights.  I also love my whey protein porrage in the morning with blueberries# shake for lunch and balanced meal for dinner.  I do eat snacks.  A Starbucks coffee (also made at home)# with 1/2 an energy bar... or# an orange.  Responsible eating.  I also understand the dynamics of over eating# being menopausal with depleated hormones.

After suffering a spinal cord injury in 1987 resulting in quadriplegia (C5/C6 complete)# I experienced disassociated pain that was concentrated in my right thumb.  The problem got increasingly worse over the following years.  I ended up having to take a lot of ibuprofen and Vicodin# just to relieve the pain announce to allow me to get some work done.  However# the resulting side effects caused me to sleep a lot.  It also lead to depression.  I was finally given a prescription for gabapentin to try out.  It started working almost immediately.  After about two weeks I was rarely having the pain in my thumb anymore.  It doesn't cause me to get sleepy or feel drugged (like the Vicodin) so I have been able to work and concentrate on things once again.  It also seems to have helped with my depression# although that may have more to do with not having to deal with the pain# or the side effects of the pain relievers I was taking before.,neurontin,2.0,1.0,9.0

I suffered from impulsive behaviors# probably the most harmful/dangerous of them being binge-eating and bulimia.  Since taking Lamictal at 300mg for 4 months now my eating habits have become completely normal.  I have not purged in 3 months.  This is amazing.  I would binge eat and purge because of anxiety.  Now I feel like a normal person--not obsessed with food# I eat when I am hungry# stop when satiated.  I have lost a LOT of weight (20 pounds in 3 months without dieting/counting calories# etc.)...nothing was wrong with my metabolism# it was the impulsive eating# stealing food from others# throwing it up (which gave me a high--not just to get rid of the calories# but it calmed me...).  I love the Lamictal for this because it's not like some meds that make you lose weight by destroying the appetite.  I am just a normal person now!  

I also quit the Lexapro as it was triggering hypomanic episodes.  The Lamictal is stabilizing my moods--it doesn't numb the depression like the SSRIs I have been on.  I feel things.  I am clear-headed.  But I am able to step back and not be hurt by every look I get from people# I am not paranoid anymore# I can wake up in the morning with energy and I fall asleep within 3 minutes of hitting the pillow.

Once I was used to the drug# it helped me get out of bed and function in day to day life better (falling asleep & getting out of bed was a serious struggle).  Eventually with the combined therapy# I pretty much now feel like myself again# just with less energy reserve and ability to have discipline with my routine.  (For instance# I can't get up early# during the 5am# 6am hours and get to work on time like I use to.  In fact I'm late for everything now which is out of my character) Can' tolerate multiple loads of stress with calmness and collectivity like I use to.

The benefits of tamoxifen have been to be cancer free 2 years after my diagnosis. Hopefully this "clean bill of health" will continue as I begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. The benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. Tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. My cancer was highly estrogen-positive. Lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. Effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits.,nolvadex,3.0,4.0,7.0

|I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder in February of 2009. I found that my manic states led to very erratic and inconsistent behavior. I also found the depressive lows to be particularly difficult to manage.

In November 2009 I was prescribed SEROQUEL by a Urgent Care Physician. Immediately I found its calming effects to be extremely relieving to my mania. I did# however# find it difficult to maintain a functioning state due to its sedating effects. I then switched to SEROQUEL XR and found a much more successful experience. I was initially given 400mg SEROQUEL XR paired with 10mg LEXAPRO. While initially a good way to stop the mania# I found 400mg to be too much to function on. I decided to halve my SEROQUEL XR dose to 200mg continuing to take 10mg of LEXAPRO. This combo has been great and I am so much calmer and feel way more in control of my life. I do# however# find the sedating effects to be difficult upon awaking in the morning. I try to offset this by ensuring that I receive a full 8-10 hour rest after administering a dosage. I would highly recommend this combo to anyone that is having difficulty finding a mental balance between dark and light. This year of treatment has allowed me to find a calm that I have never quite experienced beforehand.|,seroquel-xr,2.0,5.0,8.0

This is an NSRI# different from an SSRI because it works on more than one brain chemical. When an SSRI is ineffective or a patient finds that after a period of time a working drug stops working and symptoms of depression return they may be advised to try an NSRI. This was the case with me. I have been treated for my depression for years and had done extremely well for periods of time on several different drugs at different times. Moving from one to the next as I bottomed out on each. Celexa and Lexapro being the most recent. When Lexapro let me down after a couple of years I was advised to try Pristiq which was just released only a few months before my doctor suggested it. I was extremely hesitant as I did not want to go through another adjustment period of sleeplessness# headaches# possible weight gain# sexual issues# etc. You know the drill if you have taken drugs for deperession. So I chose to stay on my Lexapro and be depressed# hoping that it would start working again at a higher dose. Wrong. Getting to the end of my rope with my depression I finally decided to bite the bullet and try the Prestiq. My depression disappeared within 3 weeks leaving me feeling better than I had in months.

My son is generally very leary of any type of medicine and even throws up certain cough syrups and acetaminophens that I would give him.  I had two concerns for this oral medication.  First# I was skeptical that this prescription for amoxicillin would be any different in terms of taste and that my son would also throw it up.  Also# being that my son is a diabetic coupled with the fact that he was sick# I was concerned that this medication might have sugars that would affect his blood sugar readings.  I found no real difference in his health for the first two to three days but in the days following# his health improved dramatically to the point where we almost forgot to take it.

Prior to starting 1000 mg acyclovir QID# I was taking the standard 200 mg 5 times a day regimin.  I devloped the shingles in the 5th cranial nerve.  I had lesions following the entire nerve roots across my face# but had them internally as well.  There were lesions in the ear canal# the side of my tongue and down my throat.  I had taken a flu shot and had exposure to sun# as well as starting 2 new jobs about the same time as the first onset.  I developed 1 blister which I thought was herpes. I had not had a herpes outbreak in years. I started the acyclovir and noticed more and different complaints every day.  I first got a lesion on the entrance to the ear canal and more accompanying the first one on my lower chin.  Then my lower teeth began to become painful# as if I had a great toothache.  After about 4 days# I began to feel exhausted and unable to snap out of my fatigue.  The next day I awoke and had a sensation that my mouth was not fully moving.  Later the eye began to remain open and would not blink. The 3rd day of these symtoms# I devloped total paralysis of the left face. I saw 1 of my doctors immediately.  He gave me a cortisone shot and told me the dose of acyclovir to take.  He said it was bell's palsey. A friend called and said it was Ramsay-Hunt.  I was on bedrest from Mid October until 2 weeks ago.  I have very little stamina# and slowly I am getting more energy.  The latest addition to my medication arsenal was Alpha-lipoic acid.

I had years of tough# thick# dry# flaky skin on my heel and pads under my toes. As each week passed# this condition continued to improve. Almost from day one I did not experience any itchy toes or feet. At the end of the 90 days# I could see healthy nails growing up from the cuticle# although it will take several more months for the entire toe-nail on each affected toe to grow long enough that I can cut away the damaged nail.,lamisil,2.0,1.0,10.0

Cleared up my acne and brightened my skin overall; slightly reduced fine lines.  Aside from acne# it seemed to help my skin in general.  This is by far the best acne treatment I've used.  Now I use it for overall skin appearance (not just for acne).,retin-a,1.0,3.0,9.0
I have been on Paxil or generics for 9 years after a life-time of panic attacks. My attacks subsided immediately and though they recur every so often the relief has been a godsend. Even as a highly-productive and involved person it has been a lifetime of quiet fear that at any moment I would have these horrific feelings of losing my self and being depersonalized out of my body. As a few others have noted# the most common location for instant attacks is while driving. Paxil has calmed much of my life-long anxiety. I am a calmer and more socially comfortable person.,paxil,1.0,4.0,8.0
It seemed to help with the joint inflamation. Some swelling of ankles was reduced and I didn't seem as achey. I tried several sample medications first like celebrex but I liked the Mobic best. I have not gone off of it since I started to really know if it makes a difference.,mobic,3.0,3.0,7.0

With the Topamax alone# and not myself consciously changing any of my dietary habits or exercising# I lost about 10% of my body weight in the first two months of treatment. It was like a tiny switch in my brain was flipped and I just didn't crave gargantuan massive quantities of horrible-for-you food. Not that food didn't taste good# or I wasn't hungry# I just filled up really quickly# and nothing seemed any more appealing than anything else. So when you're not just going off whatever looks yummy at that exact second and you actually stop and think about what you're about to eat# you tend to choose something a tad bit healthier and less caloric. Combine that with the fact that it would take about half the amount to fill me up# and there you have your weight loss.,topamax,1.0,1.0,9.0

I ahve three sleep disorders: sleep apnea due to closing up of my throat (anatomical)# restless leg syndrome and the worst one# hypersomnia -- tired much of the time with no explanation. I tried this drug - sent directly to the home and only with approved diagnosis (I am just short of narcolepsy) - to see if I would feel rested when I awoke.

Wellbutrin XL was the only anti-depressant I tried that I could take without noticable side effects.

Due to extensive varicose veins# I was in pain# especially when standing. They were physically embarassing and I could not even wear sheer pantyhose. The surgery would eliminate pain and the ugliness.   I was told to take the drug before surgery to minimize swelling and to minimize pain.

I had some experience with Retin-A when I was a teenager in the mid 90's.  My mom and I have the same type of skin - we both have some degree of acne as adults.  In the 90's my Mom started using Retin-A to control this and apparently it worked well# so I tried it (her prescription) as a teenager and it just irritated my face # making it red and eventually flaky.  The drug is certainly powerful.  I am sure I would have benefited from continued use but I didn't.  Now# approaching 30# I still have some acne and am starting to think any acne whatsoever is unacceptable.  Reviewing options# Retin-A seems top on the list.  I have read that retinol is a distant second.  However# I am hesitant because of the inevitable initial irritation and flakyness associated with Retin-A.,retin-a,3.0,4.0,6.0

My son suffered from headaches that would really affect his daily activities. He was prescribed the Nasonex to control his allergies and reduce his sinus symptoms that may have been contributing to his headaches. After about 2 weeks of daily use of the nasonex# his headaches were occurring siginificantly less often and he felt much relief. He was able to reduce his use of ibuprofen which I was really glad for because I worried that he may have rebound headaches from over-use of ibuprofen. I also worried that he may develop an ulcer from using the NSAID's so frequently. He was also able to get a better nights sleep. That improved his performance at school and his general energy level. Previously he was always tired during the day# after he started taking the nasonex continuously# as directed# he felt more energetic# and had many less headaches# too.,nasonex,2.0,1.0,10.0

I had severe acne for many years and I was sort of living with it without seeking cures seriously. I tried a couple of other anti-biotics before but not very diligently. I started to be more disciplined and actually took Keflex every day. In the beginning I was also taking Apri the birth control pill. I took both for a couple of months and my face started to be better in a week or two and completely cleared in a couple of months - which made me so much happier with my life. Then I stop Apri# and I continued with Keflex. And it seems that if I stop Keflex# my acne will come back a little. So I have not tried stoping Keflex for more than a week or two. I am a little concerned with the long term side effects of Keflex although I am not sure whether there should be any.
